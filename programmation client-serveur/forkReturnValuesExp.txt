but isnt the pid of a chidl process 0? so why not just write 0

ChatGPT said:

The PID of a child process is not actually 0. 
The confusion arises because of the way the fork() system call works:

In the parent process, the fork() call returns the PID of the child process 
(a positive integer).
In the child process, the fork() call returns 0 to indicate that it is running
 as the child.
The child process has its own unique PID assigned by the operating system, 
but the value 0 returned by fork() is just a signal to the child process itself.
